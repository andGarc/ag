There are 3 main paths for problem-solving. Which one to chose depends on 2 things:
- How much clarity there is to the situation
- How fast you need to deliver the solution

## The 3 paths to problem solving
 - The *Hypothesis-Driven* path
 - The *Issue-Driven* path
 - The *Design-Thinking* path

## How to chose the right path 
If I can't state the problem in a clear and precise way, then I don't understand it properly.

If I can't then start with the **Design-Driven** approach.

### Issue-Driven
If I can define the problem, then go with either hypothesis- or the issue-driven path. The issue-driven should be the go to. 
My default approach is the issue-driven path because it opens up a larger solution space and avoids confirmation biases.

### Hypothesis-Driven
The goal of the hypothesis-driven path is to confirm or reject a proposed solution. So, I choose this path only in 3 cases:

1. I have a potential answer, and it is likely to be the best one. That may be the case when I have deep expertise in the field or somebody has already done a preliminary analysis.
2. The problem is simple, and I recognize a familiar pattern.
3. I don’t have enough time for a more comprehensive issue-driven approach.

Working with hypotheses makes sense when you have a good potential solution. It’s appealing because of its strengths:
- It’s fast and intuitive, saving you time and energy
- It’s easy to sell because of it’s logic and quickness
- It can make you look smart (in some circumstances, it’s better to present an idea than to say _we don’t know_)

However, for big problems, it’s risky:
- It can be misleading when you fall for the [expert trap](https://hbr.org/podcast/2019/04/avoiding-the-expertise-trap) and mistakenly recognize patterns
- It may frame the problem too narrowly, making you blind to other solutions: _What you see is all there is_
- You may communicate a solution before solving the problem, which is dangerous
- It may lead to a [confirmation bias](https://www.britannica.com/science/confirmation-bias) because, psychologically, we are more receptive to information that confirms our beliefs

Hence, be mindful and only use this approach in the following cases:
- You have a deep expertise in the field
- The problem is simple enough to be recognized as a familiar pattern (be careful of the mentioned traps)
- You don’t have time for any other solution approach
