### What is a Digital Garden? 
A digital garden is like a cross between a personal blog and a knowledge base.  
This is where I keep knowledge accumulated over my career in a series of notes.  
Mine is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) & [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). 

## Who are you exactly? 
I'm a data professional with interests in programming, ML, and data viz.  
On a personal note, I like to spend time outdoors, skiing or whitewater kayaking.
