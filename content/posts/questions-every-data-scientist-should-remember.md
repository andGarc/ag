## Hammer Time
"Hammer Problem" i.e. when you have a really nice hammer, everything looks like a nail. 
This often leads to projects which are **intellectually stimulating yet practically useless.** 

## Problems > Tech
Key lesson: **focus on problems rather than technologies.** 
Gain a sufficiently deep understanding of the business problem before writing a single line of code. 

## 5 Problem Discovery Questions 
### What problem are you trying to solve? 
### Why...?
One of the most difficult questions to ask. *Why* questions have a tendency to make people defensive. 
- Why is this important to your business (team)?
- Why do you want to solve this now? 
- What does solving this mean for your business? 
- How does this fit in to the larger goals of the business?
- Why do you want to use this tool to solve this problem?
### What is your dream outcome?
Effectively combines the *"what"* and *"why"* questions. 
Related questions:
- What does success look like?
- How would we measure it?
### What have you tried so far? 
This question starts the path towards a solution.  
When the  **client has built nothing**: 
- What is the existing solution? 
- How do you solve this problem now?
- What have others done to solve a similar problem?
### Why me? 
An effective way to reveal people's motivations.
Sparks additional context about what led them to you and how they see you fitting into the project.
